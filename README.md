# WeSplit

WeSplit is a simple, user-friendly iOS app built using SwiftUI that helps you split bills in two different ways: equally among all participants or itemized based on who shared what. The app also allows you to apply a tip to the total bill and divides the tip proportionally among the participants.

## Features

- **Equal Split**: Quickly split the bill equally among all participants, with an optional tip percentage.
- **Itemized Split**: Add individual items, assign participants to each item, and calculate the total amount each person owes based on their share.
- **Tip Integration**: Apply a tip percentage, which is proportionally distributed based on each participant's share of the total bill.
